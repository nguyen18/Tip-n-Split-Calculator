Submitted by: **Taylor Nguyen**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Create a custom tip percentage (converts whole number to decimal to calculate tip)
- [x] Split the tip and bill amongst a number of people; also shows how much tip and total per person when splitted
- [x] Always split it amongst at least 1 person
- [x] Reset button to clear the screen
- [x] UI details (rounded edges, etc.)
